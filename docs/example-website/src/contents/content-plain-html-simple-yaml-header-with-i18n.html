<h2>Simple text</h2>
<p>Plain HTML content with YAML header that defines the target path.</p>
<p>We cannot use title and shortTitle in plain HTML contents, but it still makes sense to set them such that
	we can use the get-title handlebars helper from handlebars contents.</p>

<h2>i18n</h2>
<p>Translation (i18n) tests - everything is translated to German as we have '&lt;html lang="de"&gt;'. Usually the language
is defined by the YAML section (path with more than one language), but as we don't specify a language in the YAML section,
the language is autodetected. Note that if no language can be autodetected, the fallback language
	(this.settings.i18n.fallbackLanguage) will be used.</p>
<ul>
	<li>Fully working translation, brace syntax: {i18n Hello}</li>
	<li>Translation falling back to fallback language, XML syntax: <i18n>Hi</i18n></li>
	<li>No translation available, brace syntax: {i18n Bye}</li>
</ul>

<p>We can also translate a string that is split on multiple lines:</p>

<p><i18n>
	line 1
	line 2
</i18n></p>

<p>{i18n
		line 1
		line 2
}</p>


<h2>Typography</h2>
<p>Many things are typographically constrained. For example the last word of a sentence should not be alone on a single line.</p>
<p>Also, numbers and words should not be separated: 42 years should stay on the same line.</p>
<p>Finally, a single letter cannot be left at the end of a line. So we force a single letter to be on next line.</p>
<p>It is also possible to not apply typographic rules: "<no-typo>a b c d 42 years</no-typo>" vs. "a b c d 42 years"</p>
<p>It can also span over multiple lines:
<no-typo>
	42 years

	this is a test
</no-typo>
</p>
<p>Note that the inside of HTML tags are not affected by typographic rules: <a b c d e f href="#">link</a></p>
